WIP: I'm consolidating all the es6lib-\* repositories into one. They're spammy
and don't get that much use these days. They date back to the frontend dev era
of tussles between grunt vs gulp vs webpack, browserify vs requirejs, npm vs
yarn vs bower, and left-pad vs the rest of the world, and whatever else I'm
forgetting.
