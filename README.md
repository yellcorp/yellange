This is a consolidation of all my former `es6lib-*` repositories into one.
They were spamming up my GitHub page and don't get that much use these days.
I'm also less interested than ever in maintaining them - they date back to the
frontend dev era of tussles between grunt vs gulp vs webpack, browserify vs
requirejs, npm vs yarn vs bower, and left-pad vs the rest of the world.

There may be some worthwhile things in here that could be broken off into
separate modules, but it's likely that most of this stuff exists in other more
widely-supported, better-tested, better-packaged libraries. This repository
mostly serves as a consolidated archive so any old projects using `es6lib-*`
aren't left in the lurch if they come out of retirement. You will need to
adjust require/import paths and make sure your trees are properly shaken.
