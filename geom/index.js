 * @file geom: Geometry utilities
 *
 * Contains fixed-size linear algebra classes useful for 2D and 3D geometry,
 * plus some utilities for 2D rectangles and 2D line intersections. Tries to
 * strike a balance between performance and readability of calling code.
 *
 * I could've sworn I had unit tests for these somewhere.
